# hello-world

Atouba64 here, I first got into IT through Networking.
Soon after that, I became passionated about coding and development as my teachers introduced me to C, then a little bit of Java.
Though my first breakthouhg in Development was HTML and CSS(Web development).
I recently got my CCNA and I'm preparing for my Azure-900 and AZ-104 Exam, too
Then I said "Hold on boy", since your thing is coding(though I'm actually doing networking and barely know a thing about coding:),
Let's combine your the little you know about Networking with all the coding you're intending to learn.
I have so many to learn about Coding.
Hope you guys give me a hand.
